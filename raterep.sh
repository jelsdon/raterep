# A finger-in-the-air estimater of performance via logfile activity.
# Counts new lines per interval
# Author: James Elsdon <22/07/2013>

# Motivation; Portable code that has low dependencies, and easily shipped to
# a variety of unix-like hosts.

# Example: check mysql connections/second in real time
# (subject to tail/mysql/logging outputâ€™s performance)

#$ tail -s0.1 -n0 -f /var/lib/mysql/queries.log |grep --line-buffered Connect | ./raterep.sh

# (output rate is X lines per ${s_INTERVAL})

# reader() accepts streaming character input.
# Reports on new lines read since initialisation
# or the last SIGHUP.

  # readerstat() trap handler for
  # SIGHUP. Reports newline count and

  # Set readerstat() to fire on SIGHUP
  trap readerstat SIGHUP

  # Increase newline counter every time we see a new line
  while read line
    do
    let newLineCount+=1

  # Final report (In the event we finish reading the file)
